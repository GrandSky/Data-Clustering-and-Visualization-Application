# Data Clustering and Visualization Application

 •	Developed a Flask application to visualize student performance data with interactive charts and clustering analysis. Utilized Pandas for data processing, alongside libraries like NumPy and Scikit-learn for statistical analysis. 
•	Employed K-Means clustering with PCA and MDS to reduce dimensionality, enabling insights into student data patterns with unsupervised ML.
•	Applied the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine optimal clusters, enhancing data exploration. 
•	Created dynamic data visualizations (bar charts, histograms, biplots) using D3 JavaScript and Matplotlib, while incorporating customizable color scaling based on user-selected features to enhance data interpretation and usability.

This repository already contains the csv file that works. You can use your own csv file but that will require you to change some of the code to work with the columns and rows of your csv file.
This repository also contains the d3.js file within static.

Running the code will require you to open up terminal at the directory of the app.py and run the python file this will create a local host server on port 5000 using flask.
